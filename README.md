All Things Fair is considered to be one of the best films by Bo Widerberg, who was a prominent Swedish filmmaker and writer. He was known for his realistic and humanistic style, and his films often dealt with social and political issues, such as class, gender, and sexuality. He was influenced by the French New Wave and the Italian Neorealism movements, and he was also a mentor to other Swedish directors, such as Jan Troell and Roy Andersson.
 
Some of Widerberg's other notable films include Elvira Madigan (1967), a romantic tragedy about a young couple who elope and commit suicide; Adalen 31 (1969), a historical drama about a workers' strike that turned violent; Joe Hill (1971), a biopic about the Swedish-American labor activist and songwriter; and The Serpent's Way (1986), a family saga based on a novel by Torgny Lindgren.

All Things Fair is also a film that explores the complex and controversial topic of teacher-student relationships, which have been depicted in various forms of media, such as literature, film, and television.

Teacher-student relationships are often seen as taboo and immoral, as they involve a power imbalance and a breach of trust between the parties. They can also have negative consequences for both the teacher and the student, such as legal, professional, academic, and psychological issues.
